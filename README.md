# Octosil

<h2>What is Octosil?</h2>
Octosil is an open-source Java program in its extremely early stages being developed by me and a couple of my colleagues as a personal project.

We're still deciding on what this program is going to be, but we have come up with a couple of ideas already:

video player,
music player,
general media player (video player and music player in one program),
text editor,
note/task creation program,
calendar (that will give you the ability to make notes for specific days, or make reminders... etc.),
more TBD;
