# Octosil

## What is Octosil?
Octosil was a calender program developed about a year ago by me. It was a school project, and is a rush job.

This project is not being worked on anymore - and hasn't been, for ages - but I plan on revisiting it in the future. My JavaFX skills have been getting quite rusty.
