# Octosil

## What is Octosil?
Octosil was a calender program developed about a year ago by me. It was a rushed school project, and contains code that, if I had the choice to rewrite, I would not write in the same way. It is still a sign of the progress I've made, however.

This project is not being worked on anymore - and hasn't been, for ages - but I plan on revisiting it in the future. Especially with my current knowledge of Java, Maven and Docker.
